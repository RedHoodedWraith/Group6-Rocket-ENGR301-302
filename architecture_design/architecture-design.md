# ENGR 301 Group 6 Architectural Design and Proof-of-Concept

**Dylan Sukha, Jason McCormick, Ketaki Bagal, Penny Peneueta, Robert Reid, Rowan Rathod, Sean Osborne-Curtis**

## 1. Introduction

The development of rockets over the last few decades has driven technlogy to grow in many different aspects that affect our everyday lives. Model rockets has become a growing concept globally that expands the knowledge greatly. 


Amateur rockets are flown regularly worldwide. These rockets often exceed the speed of sound and altitudes
above 30 km are not unheard of. These rockets are almost never controlled, they are stable due to passive
aerodynamic features.

While passively stable rockets are reasonably simple and reliable if well designed, they are susceptible to a
variety of disturbances, particularly early in flight. Unexpected winds can cause the rocket to weathercock;
flexibility in the launch tower/rail can cause railwhip, imparting a random launch angle to the rocket; the
thrust from the rocket motor is also never perfectly symmetrical.

The stabilising response afforded by active control provided changes depending on the measured state of the
rocket. While it requires a significant overhead of weight and complexity; active control can provide course
correction that passive stabilisation is not able to achieve.

One page overall introduction including sections 1.1 and 1.2 (ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2011(E) clause 5.2)

### Client

Identify the client and their contact details.

### 1.1 Purpose

One sentence describing the purpose of the system.

### 1.2 Scope

One paragraph describing the scope of the system.

### 1.3 Changes to requirements

If the requirement have changed significantly since the requirements document, outline the changes here. Changes must be justified and supported by evidences, i.e., they must be substantiated. (max one page, only if required)

## 2. References

References to other documents or standards. Follow the IEEE Citation Reference scheme, available from the [IEEE website](https://ieee-dataport.org/sites/default/files/analysis/27/IEEE%20Citation%20Guidelines.pdf) (PDF; 20 KB). (1 page, longer if required)

## 3. Architecture

Describe your system's architecture according to ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2011(E), ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207, ISO/IEC/IEEE 15289 and ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288.

Note in particular the note to clause 5 of 42010:

_"The verb include when used in Clause 5 indicates that either the information is present in the architecture description or reference to that information is provided therein."_

This means that you should refer to information (e.g. risks, requirements, models) in this or other documents rather than repeat information.

### 3.1 Stakeholders

See ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010 clause 5.3 and ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207 clause 6.4.4.3(2).

For most systems this will be about 2 pages, including a table mapping concerns to stakeholder.

### 3.2 Architectural Viewpoints
(1 page, 42010 5.4) 

Identify the architectural viewpoints you will use to present your system's architecture. Write one sentence to outline each viewpoint. Show which viewpoint frames which architectural concern.

### 4. Architectural Views

(5 sub-sections of 2 pages each sub-section, per 42010, 5.5, 5.6, with reference to Annex F of both 12207 and 15288) 

Describe your system's architecture in a series of architectural views, each view corresponding to one viewpoint.

You should include views from the following viewpoints (from Kruchten's 4+1 model):

 * Logical
 * Development
 * Process
 * Physical 
 * Scenarios - present scenarios illustrating how two of your most important use cases are supported by your architecture

As appropriate you should include the following viewpoints:

 * Circuit Architecture
 * Hardware Architecture

Each architectural view should include at least one architectural model. If architectural models are shared across views, refer back to the first occurrence of that model in your document, rather than including a separate section for the architectural models.

### 4.1 Logical
...

### 4.2 Development
...

### 4.3 Process
...

### 4.4 Physical 
...

### 4.5 Scenarios
...

## 5. Development Schedule

_For each subsection, make clear what (if anything) has changed from the requirements document._ If unchanged, these sections should be copied over from the requirements document, not simply cross-referenced.

Schedules must be justified and supported by evidences; they must be either direct client requirements or direct consequences of client requirements. If the requirements document did not contain justifications or supporting evidences, then both must be provided here.

### 5.1 Schedule

Identify dates for key project deliverables:

1. prototype(s).
1. first deployment to the client.
1. further improvements required or specified by the client.

(1 page).

### 5.2 Budget and Procurement

#### 5.2.1 Budget

Present a budget for the project (as a table), showing the amount of expenditure the project requires and the date(s) on which it will be incurred. Substantiate each budget item by reference to fulfilment of project goals (one paragraph per item).

(1 page). 

#### 5.2.2 Procurement

Present a table of goods or services that will be required to deliver project goals and specify how they are to be procured (e.g. from the School or from an external organisation). These may be software applications, libraries, training or other infrastructure, including open source software. Justify and substantiate procurement with reference to fulfilment of project goals, one paragraph per item.
(1 page).

### 5.3 Risks 

Identify the ten most important project risks: their type, likelihood, impact, and mitigation strategies (3 pages).

### 5.4 Health and Safety

Document here project requirements for Health and Safety.

#### 5.4.1 Safety Plans

Safety Plans may be required for some projects, depending on project requirements.


## 6. Appendices

### 6.1 Assumptions and dependencies 

One page on assumptions and dependencies (9.5.7) 

### 6.2 Acronyms and abbreviations

One page glossary as required 

## 7. Contributions

An one page statement of contributions, including a list of each member of the group and what they contributed to this document.

## Formatting Rules 

 * Write your document using [Markdown](https://gitlab.ecs.vuw.ac.nz/help/user/markdown#gitlab-flavored-markdown-gfm) in your team's GitLab repository.
 * Major sections should be separated by a horizontal rule.


## Assessment 

This document will be weighted at 20% on the architectural proof-of-concept(s), and 80% on the architecture design.

The proof-of-concept will be assessed for coverage (does it demonstrate all the technologies needed to build your project?) and quality (with an emphasis on simplicity, modularity, and modifiability).

The document will be assessed by considering both presentation and content. Group and individual group members will be assessed by identical criteria, the group mark for the finished PDF and the individual mark on the contributions visible through `git blame`, `git diff`, file histories, etc. 

The presentation will be based on how easy it is to read, correct spelling, grammar, punctuation, clear diagrams, and so on.

The content will be assessed according to its clarity, consistency, relevance, critical engagement and a demonstrated understanding of the material in the course. We look for evidence these traits are represented and assess the level of performance against these traits. Inspection of the GitLab Group is the essential form of assessing this document. While being comprehensive and easy to understand, this document must be reasonably concise too. You will be affected negatively by writing a report with too many pages (far more than what has been suggested for each section above).
