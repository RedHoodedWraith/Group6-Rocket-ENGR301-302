# Group 6's Rocket Project
## Introduction
This project was developed as part of an in-class group project to design and develop a hobbyist rocket that used on-board programmable electronics to control it and to collect and report on-board telemetry.</br>
It was developed in 2020 by students in Group 6 from the ENGR301 & ENGR302 courses at the Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand.

While the students who worked on this project passed the aforementioned courses, at the time of writing, this project is in an unfinished state.
