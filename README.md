# Group 6's Rocket Project
## Introduction
This project was developed as part of an in-class group project to design and develop a hobbyist rocket that used on-board programmable electronics to control it and to collect and report on-board telemetry.</br>
It was developed in 2020 by students in Group 6 from the [ENGR301](https://www.wgtn.ac.nz/courses/engr/301/2020) & [ENGR302](https://www.wgtn.ac.nz/courses/engr/302/2020) courses at the Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand. 

While the students who worked on this project passed the aforementioned courses, at the time of writing, this project is in an unfinished state and there is not functioning rocket.</br>
The courses, ENGR301 & ENGR302, were focused on developing our skills around working on technical projects as part of a development team that uses Agile Development Practices. In the context of the courses above, this project was worked on to put into practice what we had learnt and to demonstrate our skills relating to using Agile.

While this project is incomplete and isn't likely to be worked on, anyone is welcome to use what we have made so far and/or to finish it off.
